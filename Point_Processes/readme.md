Point process for synthetic spike generation. An implementation of algorith 1 from Thinning Algorithms for Simulating Point Processes by Yuanda Chen - 2016. Given the intensity function is constant this is a basic primer and thus is not an accurate representation of neural data. Never the less a good intro to point processes before moving onto imhomogenous point processes.

Combining algorithm 1 with a imhomogenous poisson process (algo 2) results in a suitable synthetic spike generator as seen below:
